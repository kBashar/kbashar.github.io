As a gsoc student I'm going to code to improve the [PDFDebugger](https://pdfbox.apache.org/1.8/commandline.html#pdfDebugger) tool of the [PDFBOX](https://pdfbox.apache.org/ "PDFBOX") this summer. PDFBox is from the [apache](http://www.apache.org/ "Apache") foundation.

PDFDebugger helps you to inspect the internal data in a structured and readable way which in turn paves a way to debug your PDF files. The PDFBOX already has a PDFDebugger which provides some fundamental facilities to user but lacks many more which are very useful for PDF detective works. My project is to improve this tool and make it useable and friendlier for the users as much as possible. The features I'm going to add are from the [PDFBOX-2530](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2530) jira issue. If time permits, I may code some more.

My mentor is [Tilman Hausherr](https://twitter.com/Passwort12345). I contacted with him in mid of the November of 2014 and from the beginning he was very helpful to get me on the track. Really lucky to have someone like him right beside me as a guide in the journey of learning, exploring and doing. Iâ€™m hopeful to spent a fun summer while completing the GSOC as success story.
