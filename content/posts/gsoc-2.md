### It has started after all.

Summer has started as much awesomely as possible for me. Write code, get feedback, update and learn. What else you need if you love to code! One of the most anticipated event for me was participating in GSOC ([Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015)) and after trying for two consecutive years I was at last [selected](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/kbashar/5676830073815040) this year. And I’m coding this year in Apache foundation and to be more precise in [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/). After almost month long community bonding phase code writing phase has after all started from 25th May.

### Code is being committed

Though community bonding was to get introduced with the community and getting your hands wet with code base and documentation I was some steps already walked on these. So have started code earlier though didn’t make remarkable patches. Don’t know, may be it’s always slow for the first time. :D Anyway already I’ve made three patches, two of them slightly large in size :)

### Coding plan

My mentor wants me to make little patches as those are easy to merge and refactor for both of us and I’m highly appreciating on this. The patches I’ve submitted helped me to learn a lot already while giving the community the opportunity to use the just backed features. Which in turn gives me feedback to make code better.

### Blogging plan

I'm planning to write experience-per-patch post. I hope it also doesn't become another mountain lifting promise because of my procrastination. :D
